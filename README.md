# Final Project

BrainPet is a tamagotchi-like web app where the goal is to keep your virtual pet alive by tending to its needs.

## The idea

My goal was to create a virtual pet app that could integrate a learning aspect that allowed my students to solve exercises and gain coins and experience for their pets. The scope was a little ambitious for the given time frame, so it ended up just being a regular tamagotchi app for the hand-in, but I intend on developing the original idea later down the line.

## Technologies used

- Frontend: React + TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB + mongoose
- Authentication: JWT
- Navigation: TanStack Router
- State management: Zustand
- External libraries: Framer Motion + node-cron + bcrypt
- Extracurricular hooks: useNavigate, useLocation.
- Additional tools: Figma, Postman, Lighthouse, Trello.

The application is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop (320px - 1600px) and supported on Chrome, Safari and Firefox. It follows accessibility standards, clean code practices and has a 100% score on Lighthouse.
